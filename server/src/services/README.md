# Microservices Architecture

## Core Services

### Agent Service
- Location: `/services/agent`
- Responsibility: Manages autonomous agent behavior and lifecycle
- Components:
  - Agent creation and configuration
  - Task processing
  - Status management
  - Event handling

### Event Bus Service
- Location: `/services/eventBus.ts`
- Responsibility: Handles inter-service communication
- Features:
  - Redis-based pub/sub
  - Event distribution
  - Service discovery

### Identity Service
- Location: `/services/identity`
- Responsibility: User authentication and authorization
- Features:
  - User management
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Session management

### Project Service
- Location: `/services/project`
- Responsibility: Project management
- Features:
  - Project CRUD operations
  - Team management
  - Resource allocation

### Analytics Service
- Location: `/services/analytics`
- Responsibility: System analytics and monitoring
- Features:
  - Performance metrics
  - Usage statistics
  - System health monitoring

### Billing Service
- Location: `/services/billing`
- Responsibility: Payment and subscription management
- Features:
  - Payment processing
  - Subscription management
  - Usage billing

## Service Communication

Services communicate through:
1. Event Bus (Redis) for real-time events
2. RESTful APIs for direct communication
3. Kafka for event streaming (when needed)
4. Socket.IO for real-time client updates

## Event Types

1. Agent Events:
   - agent:created
   - agent:updated
   - agent:deleted
   - agent:task_assigned
   - agent:status_changed

2. Project Events:
   - project:created
   - project:updated
   - project:deleted
   - project:member_added
   - project:member_removed

3. User Events:
   - user:created
   - user:updated
   - user:deleted
   - user:login
   - user:logout

4. System Events:
   - system:error
   - system:warning
   - system:metrics

## Best Practices

1. Service Independence:
   - Each service should be independently deployable
   - Services should have their own database schema
   - Minimize inter-service dependencies

2. Event-Driven:
   - Use events for asynchronous operations
   - Maintain eventual consistency
   - Handle failures gracefully

3. Security:
   - Implement authentication at service boundaries
   - Use secure communication channels
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

4. Monitoring:
   - Implement health checks
   - Log important events
   - Track performance metrics
